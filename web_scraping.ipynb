       "\"When you are looking for reasonably priced accommodation in Manhattan you won't have too many options! This hostel has a great location near many bus and subway lines, and walking distance to some of the midtown sights. It's on a relatively quiet street considering you're in the middle of a busy city. I felt perfectly safe as a solo female walking around the area late at night.  The room is basic - I would say not as nice looking as the photos on the website make it seem - and the mattress really needed replacing. However - both my room and the shared facilities seemed clean, it had aircon, and I never had to wait for the shared shower / toilet.   Breakfast is included which is nice - fruit / bagels / various muffins or cakes and donuts / waffles. There is a fridge and some shared kitchen facilities for basic cooking.  I have marked this down slightly as I really felt the staff could have been a bit friendlier - I rarely got greeted when I came in or out, and despite being there for a week no one asked me how my stay was. When I said hello to one of the ladies preparing breakfast, I barely got a response, and she then proceeded to say the kitchen was too small as a couple of us were stood up at the table putting food on our plates when she was trying to get by. It's worth mentioning also that this isn't a party hostel or a particularly social hostel - I was a solo traveller but didn't meet any one else to go out with, which was fine as I wasn't really looking for that.  Overall I would stay again - the location and clean facilities sold it to me.â€¦\""
